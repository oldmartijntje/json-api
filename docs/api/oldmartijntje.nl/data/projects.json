                "text": "This project serves as an engaging educational tool designed to teach children the fundamentals of programming logic in a playful manner. Developed using Python's tkinter, it takes the form of a dungeon crawler game where players program their character's movements. The objective is to navigate through the dungeon, facing various enemies and collecting items while progressing through numerous levels. The flexibility of the project lies in its customization features; nearly everything, from powerful enemies with minimal health to diverse game elements, can be tailored by adjusting JSON files. Players exert control over the game dynamics using Python code commands, such as player.moveUp(). This unique approach allows users to elevate the complexity of the game, fostering a dynamic learning experience. In the Gallery tab, the second image showcases a user who has even created a simple GUI, highlighting the project's adaptability and creative potential.",

Over time, the webpage editing functionality was removed due to its complexity and resource intensity. The editor supported programming in JavaScript and Marjinscript, a language specifically designed for this platform, incorporating loops, commands, and importable modules. A separate console was provided for code input, along with an output window displaying code results and an error window highlighting any encountered errors. Surprisingly, this editor predates the website's home page. Presently, it serves as a streamlined code editor, supporting JavaScript execution. However, features such as output windows, compatibility with webpage editing, and Marjinscript support have been deprecated. Although technically feasible, executing code in languages other than JavaScript is limited to syntax highlighting without execution capabilities.",
